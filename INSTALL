1) Create a file .simpledd in your home directory. You may start with
the file simpledd.example. Entries are:

$interval - minimum numer of seconds between two ip-checks. Choose at
least 600. Otherwise you mess with dyndns.

$name - your user name at dyndns

$pass - your password

$hostname - the server name which points to your ip-address

The file should contain regular Perl code i.e. every line should end
with a semicolon.

2) Put the binary simpledd with the executable flag set somewhere, where
your cronjob can execute it.

3) create the files "$ENV{HOME}/var/simpledd/time" and
"$ENV{HOME}/var/simpledd/ip" with just one line containing 0. If you
don't like location of the file, just edit the Perl code.

4) Try calling simpledd from the shell.

5) If you want less messages, just change the log level in the Perl
code.

6) If you get Perl error messages about missing libraries, then you
should install these libraries via CPAN or via your packet manager.

7) put the following line in your crontab

*/6 * * * * /path/to/simpledd

Of course you change /path/to to the right path which you have chosen
under point 2. You should get e-mails whenever simpledd emits a
message. How many this will be depends on the log level.

8) Don't forget to open the desired ports in your router. And watch
out for security patches for these services.

9) Have fun!
